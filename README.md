# LSTM-Music-Recognition

The uses that recurrent neural networks (RNN) have on musical compositions, specifically LSTM networks,
are many and very broad. From the creation of new compositions to recognition of their complex characteristics. 
With a valid and extensive “learning” data set, complex analysis functions can be performed.

The objective of this project is the design of a system that allows to evaluate the use of RNN models on musical pieces represented in MIDI 
format (digital music format that stores the greatest number of composition characteristics). 
MIDI databases will be founded and evaluated. Different RNN models will be designed and evaluated for the characterization of musical patterns.

A database of musical compositions in MIDI format will be created and then two scenarios will be proposed for which we will evaluate different recurrent network 
schemes mainly LSTM. We will make use of the Keras library in Python. In each case, different network configurations will be evaluated in search of the best results.
Finally, all the work will be collected together with the experiments and results obtained in this report on this End of Degree Project.
